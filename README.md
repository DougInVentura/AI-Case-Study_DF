# Business Case Study for “Unlearn”: Using AI to accelerate Pharma Clinical trials using “Digital Twins”
## Overview and Origin: 
Unlearn specializes in creating digital twins for clinical trials. They employ advanced biostatistics and machine learning to mimic and predict patient outcomes. Use of digital twins leads to smaller, quicker studies by reducing the need for large control groups. This makes clinical trials more cost-effective. Since clinical trials are a significant part of the drug development process, these efficiency gains lower cost and speed the development and delivery of vital therapeutics to patients. This technology has attracted interest from pharmaceutical and biotech companies, including a collaboration with Merck KGaA for late-stage clinical trials ([TechChrunch: "Unlearn.AI, a startup developing a ‘digital twin’ service for clinical trials, raises $50M"](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/19/unlearn-ai-a-startup-developing-a-digital-twin-service-for-clinical-trials-raises-50m/)). 

The company constructs digital twins using machine learning, where extensive clinical trial data from numerous patients is used to create the digital twin based on the actual characteristics and statistical propensities of an actual person in the clinical studies. The AI twins simulate individual health trajectories and contrast potential outcomes under various scenarios. This can be used to aid in the assessment of treatment effects. Unlearn's efforts also help with achieving full enrollment of clinical trials, which can be a significant impediment to both drup development cost and the associated timeline according to the company's website ([UnLearn's website](https://www.unlearn.ai/)). Along these lines, according to ChatGPT, “they work closely with pharmaceutical and biotech innovators to hasten drug development. As a leading AI healthcare company, Unlearn is dedicated to advancing AI to reduce trial and error in medicine and is actively recruiting like-minded, driven innovators to shape the future of medical technology” as part of their approach.

**When was the company incorporated?**
The company was incorporated in 2017 by Charles Fisher. They’re headquarters are in San Francisco, California.

**Who are the founders of the company?** 
On their website ([UnLearn](https://www.unlearn.ai/about])), Charles Fisher is listed as a co-founder and CEO, Aaron Smith is listed as a co-founder and Machine Learning Scientist, and Jon Walsh is listed as a co-founder and Head of Modeling.

**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?** 
Charles Fisher, CEO and Co-Founder wrote an article called “Why did we start UnLearn”, [UnLearnAI.SubStack.com](https://unlearnai.substack.com/p/why-did-we-start-unlearn).  In this article, Charles indicates that the company was not founded on a medical application initially. Instead, they were broadly focused on generative AI models, rather than discriminative models, mentioning potential applications in the original VC application, rather than committing to anything specific. Other companies were focused on text and image usages of generative AI and they ultimately decided on specializing on a medical application. During this initial formation of the company, they came across the idea for digital twins for clinical trials.  Some of the early problems they investigated was “simulating health outcomes for patients in clinical trials, simulating the effects of perturbations on gene expression, and even simulating the weather" ([UnLearnAI.Substack.com]( https://unlearnai.substack.com/p/why-did-we-start-unlearn)). Simulating of health outcomes was an idea mentioned in the quest for the original VC seed money. Going forward, they believe there are large untapped areas for AI in medicine and they have identified this as their area of larger focus. 

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**
According the [BusinessWire - Unlean Closes $50 million...](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220419005354/en/Unlearn-Closes-50-Million-Series-B-Funding-to-Advance-the-Use-of-Its-Machine-Learning-Powered-TwinRCTs%E2%84%A2-in-Clinical-Trials), the company raised $50 million in their Series B funding.  The article also states that “The financing was led by New York-based global venture capital and private equity firm Insight Partners with participation from new investor Radical Ventures, as well as all of the company’s existing investors including 8VC, DCVC, DCVC Bio and Mubadala Capital Ventures.”
In a separate article on the [TechChrunch website](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/19/unlearn-ai-a-startup-developing-a-digital-twin-service-for-clinical-trials-raises-50m/), between the original funding and the Series B funding, the company raised a total of $69.35 million dollars. 

## Business Activities
According to the article “AI startup Unlearn adds $50M for better, faster, smaller & cheaper clinical trials” found at [MedCityNews - UnLearn](https://medcitynews.com/2022/04/ai-startup-unlearn-adds-50m-for-better-faster-smaller-cheaper-clinical-trials/#:~:text=,speed%20up%20their%20clinical%20research), following a favorable opinion regarding the use of the technology for pharma clinical studies by the European Medicines Agency (EMA is the European equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Agency (FDA)), Unlearn is focused on increasing the number of clinical trials using this technology. The article also indicates that another business activity was to get the EMA and FDA to rule broadly and endorse the use of their technology. That is, instead of just getting approval for each specific clinical trial, Unlearn was also focused on getting the agencies to rule more broadly on the use of Digital Twins in pharma clinical trials. This would lower the risk for pharma companies which wanted to use the technology for upcoming clinical trials, but were concerned with its acceptance by regulators. In getting the EMA to review and give an initial draft ruling on their technology, the EWA has agreed with UnLearn that the technology can lead to enhance the speed and efficiency of randomized, controlled clinical trials. This will facilitate going after more companies that are conducting clinical trials, with less concern regarding if the agencies will accept the clinical trial design using the digital twins.

**What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
According to a John Hopkins article titled “Cost of Clinical Trials For New Drug FDA Approval Are Fraction of Total Tab“ ([PublicHealth - Clinical Trials](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2018/cost-of-clinical-trials-for-new-drug-FDA-approval-are-fraction-of-total-tab#:~:text=Clinical%20trials%20that%20support%20FDA,Bloomberg%20School%20of%20Public%20Health)), while the cost of clinicals is only a fraction of the total median drug development costs, the average cost of drug clinical studies is $19 million. Cost savings and time reduction in this part of the development process is UnLearn’s current area of focus. The use of smaller control groups also means that more patients entering the drug trial will have access to the treatment under test, which often represents improvements in the treatment approach, which can be of benefit to more of the study participants.

**Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?** 
UnLearn’s primary customer are pharma companies that are conducting clinical trials.  According to [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/resources/trends#:~:text=ClinicalTrials,States%20and%20in%20223%20countries), there are currently over 475,000 clinical studies that are registered and on-going worldwide. The potential market size is quite large.

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**  
Unlearn is not the only company focused on the use of Digital Twins in clinical trials. According to [Altis Labs website](https://www.altislabs.com/news/altis-labs-launches-digital-twins-for-clinical-trials-with-global-biopharmaceuticals-leading-research-institutions), Altis Labs is also using this type of technology for clinical trials.  They are partnered with AstraZeneca and Bayer Pharmaceuticals. While UnLean is focused on more broadly on the creation and use of digital twins in clinicals, Altis is focused more narrowly on their specific imaging platform and application of the technology to cancer patients.

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**
According to [Unlearn’s website technology section](https://www.unlearn.ai/technology), Unlearn “AI research centers on deep learning-based generative models for multivariate stochastic processes and associated clinical applications. In other words, we aim to simulate ‘what if?’ scenarios for individual patients so that we can computationally compare potential health outcomes.” On the same website, they also state “Our research is at the cutting edge of generative AI for multivariate time-series. We build and deploy new types of machine learning models for forecasting potential health outcomes for individual patients.” As mentioned above, they are focused on generative AI applications, rather than discriminative models.

## Landscape


**What field is the company in?**
This has been covered above, but in brief, they are involved with the introduction of the use of digital twins to lower the clinical sample size requirements in the control arm to accelerate study enrollment, decrease study timelines and decrease study costs.  They identify their applications more broadly as looking for opportunities to use generative AI in medical applications.

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5 to 10 years?**
There have been major applications in the application of generative AI, which was UnLearn’s original broad focus, over the past few years including text to image applications such as Mid-Journey, DALL-E and Stable Diffusion. ChatGPT and Bard are two examples of the use of generative AI in Large Language Models (LLMs) as digital assistants which have captured the publics interest.

In the area of improving clinical studies, [Elluminate IQs Website](https://www.eclinicalsol.com/products/elluminate-iq/?utm_term=artificial%20intelligence%20for%20clinical%20trials&utm_campaign=Clinical+Data&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_acc=6723577425&hsa_cam=14648494790&hsa_grp=126429184479&hsa_ad=545669540319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-816797026459&hsa_kw=artificial%20intelligence%20for%20clinical%20trials&hsa_mt=p&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=CjwKCAiA98WrBhAYEiwA2WvhOjjxzYewGCE5O6ABXoXpI6-U4WIJa3l9ScyOFzSlwRfPb1K5ielSihoCLSAQAvD_BwE) indicates they are a company using AI to improve and accelerate review of clinical data and certain clinical workflows. They do not work with digital twins.

The Association Of Clinical Research Professionals (ACRP) have an article on their website titled [Forward Thinking for the Integration of AI into Clinical Trials](https://www.acrpnet.org/2023/06/forward-thinking-for-the-integration-of-ai-into-clinical-trials/#:~:text=In%20short%2C%20AI%20can%20help,AI%20could%20improve%20subject%20retention) which mentions a number of applications for AI in clinical research. There include
- Identifying and screening potential participants 
- Improve patient monitoring during clinical trials
- Combining AI with wearable technologies to simplify self-reporting data collection

as well as other applications. Of the other applications listed, none seem to conflict with Unlearn’s digital twin technology.

**What are the other major companies in this field?**
As mentioned above, only Altis Labs is also working with the idea of using digital twins in clinical trials. 
An article by [BioPharmaTrend.com called "9 Notable AI Companies in Clinical Research to Watch in 2023"](https://www.biopharmatrend.com/post/243-7-notable-ai-companies-in-clinical-research-to-watch-in-2020/) covers nine companies involved in this space.
Three notable are: 
1)	ConcertAI, which “launched its CTO 2.0 solution to enhance the design and execution of clinical trials by leveraging expanded data assets from public sources, which include site and physician-level trial information”.
2)	Saama, which “in 2023, Saama has unveiled a unified SaaS platform powered by AI and advanced analytics intended to streamline clinical development processes and reduce manual tasks. The platform incorporates over 90 AI models specialized for life sciences and is trained on more than 300 million data points.”
3)	PathAI, which “is a supplier of AI-enabled image analysis for pathology, including applications to support clinical trials.”

## Results
**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**
As a private company, their revenue and profits have not been disclosed to the public. They have had several impactful accomplishments that are publicly disclosed. According to [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220216005466/en/Unlearn-Signs-Multi-Year-Collaboration-with-Merck-KGaA-Darmstadt-Germany-to-Accelerate-Immunology-Trials-using-Twintelligent-RCTs%E2%84%A2), they have achieved “Multi-Year Collaboration with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany”. In the same article, Fisher is quoted as saying “Our solution has successfully proven that it can reduce the size of control arms by 30% or more and generate reliable clinical evidence in a fraction of the time.” As mentioned above, this improves achieving clinical enrollment target earlier and give more patients access to potentially beneficial treatments in the clinical trial (i.e. – high proportion of patients in the test group and decreased numbers in the control group, who do not receive the treatment under test).

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?**
Some potential metrics the company could report include:
- Cost savings with specific clinicals (average, or median, or max savings)
- Control sample size reduction
- Impact on time to complete enrollment
- Number of pharma or other partners
- After going public, revenue, profit and projections for both going forward.

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?**
Achieving a draft acceptance of their technology by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) was a major step forward in establishing acceptance of their approach by Pharma companies. UnLearn’s only competitor that I came across with respect to use of digital twins in clinical studies was Altis Labs, which is more narrowly focused on use of their specific imaging platform and on oncology, as mentioned above.

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**
A couple more obvious applications would be to form partnerships outside of just the pharma industry, including biologics, diagnostics and medical devices. Also as their technology advances, perhaps the same approach that generates a clinical digital twin could be employed to give patients a probabilistic model of health outcomes on their current trajectory and/or lifestyle. This could be contrasted with various possible treatment strategies as well as lifestyle changes (nutrition and exercise, for example).

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**
The application of digital twins in medical device and biologics should essentially be the same pharma clinicals. There may also be opportunity in the diagnostic space as well, but I’m not as familiar with that industry, so this would need further vetting. 

With respect to using the digital twin approach to generating probabilistic forecasts of individual patient’s health trajectory, this seems like a reasonable next step as they get more sophisticated. This would especially be useful if they could incorporate modeling both treatment strategies and lifestyle changes to show patients potential change strategies.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**
With respect to modeling and contrasting patient outcomes between current forecasted trajectories versus potential trajectories with new treatments and/or lifestyle changes, other machine learning techniques as well as classical statistical techniques would likely be complementary.

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**
While UnLearn is currently focused on their core technology of Generative AI, these other technologies may work synergistically with the initial application they are using with generative AI. Currently a lot of the current data on various treatments and lifestyle changes have been analyzed and summarized using classical statistical techniques and this data is likely more plentiful than AI analysis of the same type of data.
